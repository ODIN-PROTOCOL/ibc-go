It was subsequently migrated to its own repository, ibc-go. The first official release on ibc-go was v1.0.0. v1.0.0 was decided to be used instead of v0.1.0 primarily for the following reasons: Maintaining compatibility with the IBC specification v1 requires stronger support/guarantees. Using the major, minor, and patch numbers allows for easier communication of what breaking changes are included in a release. The IBC module is being used by numerous high value projects which require stability.","s":"Context","u":"/architecture/adr-002-go-module-versioning/","h":"/architecture/adr-002-go-module-versioning/#context","p":1156},{"i":1164,"t":"Go module version must be incremented​ When a Go module is released under v1.0.0, all following releases must follow Go semantic versioning. Thus when the go API is broken, the Go module major version must be incremented. For example, changing the go package version from v2 to v3 bumps the import from github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v2 to github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v3. If the Go module version is not incremented then attempting to go get a module @v3.0.0 without the suffix results in: invalid version: module contains a go.mod file, so major version must be compatible: should be v0 or v1, not v3 Version validation was added in Go 1.13. This means that in order to release a v3.0.0 git tag without a /v3 suffix on the module definition, the tag must explicitly not contain a go.mod file. Not including a go.mod in our release is not a viable option. Attempting to import multiple go module versions for ibc-go​ Attempting to import two versions of ibc-go, such as github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v2 and github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v3, will result in multiple issues. The Cosmos SDK does global registration of error and governance proposal types. The errors and proposals used in ibc-go would need to now register their naming based on the go module version. The more concerning problem is that protobuf definitions will also reach a namespace collision. ibc-go and the Cosmos SDK in general rely heavily on using extended functions for go structs generated from protobuf definitions. This requires the go structs to be defined in the same package as the extended functions. Thus, bumping the import versioning causes the protobuf definitions to be generated in two places (in v2 and v3). When registering these types at compile time, the go compiler will panic. The generated types need to be registered against the proto codec, but there exist two definitions for the same name. The protobuf conflict policy can be overridden via the environment variable GOLANG_PROTOBUF_REGISTRATION_CONFLICT, but it is possible this could lead to various runtime errors or unexpected behaviour (see here). More information here on namespace conflicts for protobuf versioning.","s":"Problems","u":"/architecture/adr-002-go-module-versioning/","h":"/architecture/adr-002-go-module-versioning/#problems","p":1156},{"i":1166,"t":"Changing the protobuf definition version​ The protobuf definitions all have a type URL containing the protobuf version for this type. Changing the protobuf version would solve the namespace collision which arise from importing multiple versions of ibc-go, but it leads to new issues. In the Cosmos SDK, Anys are unpacked and decoded using the type URL. Changing the type URL thus is creating a distinctly different type. The same registration on the proto codec cannot be used to unpack the new type. For example: All Cosmos SDK messages are packed into Anys. If we incremented the protobuf version for our IBC messages, clients which submitted the v1 of our Cosmos SDK messages would now be rejected since the old type is not registered on the codec. The clients must know to submit the v2 of these messages. This pushes the burden of versioning onto relayers and wallets. A more serious problem is that the ClientState and ConsensusState are packed as Anys. Changing the protobuf versioning of these types would break compatibility with IBC specification v1. Moving protobuf definitions to their own go module​ The protobuf definitions could be moved to their own go module which uses 0.x versioning and will never go to 1.0. This prevents the Go module version from being incremented with breaking changes. It also requires all extended functions to live in the same Go module, disrupting the existing code structure. The version that implements this change will still be incompatible with previous versions, but future versions could be imported together without namespace collisions.

This includes such details as: The SignedHeader containing the commitment root. The ValidatorSet that signed the Header. The TrustedHeight seen by the client at less than or equal to the height of Header. The last TrustedValidatorSet at the trusted height.

For example, a batched client update message serialized as a Protobuf Any type for the 07-tendermint lightclient implementation could be defined as follows: message BatchedHeaders { repeated Header headers = 1; } To complement this flexibility, the UpdateClient handler will now support the submission of client misbehaviour by consolidating the Header and Misbehaviour interfaces into a single ClientMessage interface type: // ClientMessage is an interface used to update an IBC client. // The update may be done by a single header, a batch of headers, misbehaviour, or any type which when verified produces // a change to state of the IBC client type ClientMessage interface { proto.Message ClientType() string ValidateBasic() error } To support this functionality the GetHeight() method has been omitted from the new ClientMessage interface. Emission of standardised events from the 02-client submodule now becomes problematic and is two-fold: The 02-client submodule previously depended upon the GetHeight() method of Header types in order to retrieve the updated consensus height.

The Packet relay sending works based in 2 cases (per specification and Colin Axnér's description): Sender chain is acting as the source zone. The coins are transferred to an escrow address (i.e locked) on the sender chain and then transferred to the receiving chain through IBC TAO logic. It is expected that the receiving chain will mint vouchers to the receiving address. Sender chain is acting as the sink zone. The coins (vouchers) are burned on the sender chain and then transferred to the receiving chain through IBC TAO logic. It is expected that the receiving chain, which had previously sent the original denomination, will unescrow the fungible token and send it to the receiving address. Another way of thinking of source and sink zones is through the token's timeline. Each send to any chain other than the one it was previously received from is a movement forwards in the token's timeline. This causes trace to be added to the token's history and the destination port and destination channel to be prefixed to the denomination. In these instances the sender chain is acting as the source zone. When the token is sent back to the chain it previously received from, the prefix is removed. This is a backwards movement in the token's timeline and the sender chain is acting as the sink zone.","s":"Context","u":"/architecture/adr-001-coin-source-tracing/","h":"/architecture/adr-001-coin-source-tracing/#context","p":1347},{"i":1355,"t":"Assume the following channel connections exist and that all channels use the port ID transfer: chain A has channels with chain B and chain C with the IDs channelToB and channelToC, respectively chain B has channels with chain A and chain C with the IDs channelToA and channelToC, respectively chain C has channels with chain A and chain B with the IDs channelToA and channelToB, respectively These steps of transfer between chains occur in the following order: A -> B -> C -> A -> C. In particular: A -> B: sender chain is source zone. A sends packet with denom (escrowed on A), B receives denom and mints and sends voucher transfer/channelToA/denom to recipient. B -> C: sender chain is source zone.

This poses a problem because, while port and channel identifiers have a maximum length of 64 each, the SDK Coin type only accepts denoms up to 64 characters. Thus, a single cross-chain token, which again, is composed by the port and channels identifiers plus the base denomination, can exceed the length validation for the SDK Coins. This can result in undesired behaviours such as tokens not being able to be transferred to multiple sink chains if the denomination exceeds the length or unexpected panics due to denomination validation failing on the receiving chain. The existence of special characters and uppercase letters on the denomination: In the SDK every time a Coin is initialized through the constructor function NewCoin, a validation of a coin's denom is performed according to a Regex, where only lowercase alphanumeric characters are accepted.

Currently there exists two different approaches to callbacks being invoked by core IBC. IBC light clients currently are invoked by a ClientState and ConsensusState interface as defined by core IBC. The 02-client submodule will retrieve the ClientState or ConsensusState from the IBC store in order to perform callbacks to the light client. This design requires all required information for the light client to function to be stored in the ClientState or ConsensusState or potentially under metadata keys for a specific client instance. Additional information may be provided by core IBC via the defined interface arguments if that information is generic enough to be useful to all IBC light clients. This constraint has proved problematic as pass through clients (such as wasm) cannot maintain easy access to a VM instance. In addition, without increasing the size of the defined ClientState interface, light clients are unable to take advantage of basic built-in SDK functionality such as genesis import/export and migrations. The other approach used to perform callback logic is via registered SDK modules. This approach is used by core IBC to interact with IBC applications. IBC applications will register their callbacks on the IBC router at compile time. When a packet comes in, core IBC will use the IBC router to lookup the registered callback functions for the provided packet. The benefit of registered callbacks opposed to interface functions is that additional information may be accessed via external keepers. Because the IBC applications are also SDK modules, they additionally get access to a host of functionality provided by the SDK. This includes: genesis import/export, migrations, query/transaction CLI commands, type registration, gRPC query registration, and message server registration. As described in ADR 006, generalizing light client behaviour is difficult.

Over time and as necessary, core IBC should adjust its interactions with light clients such that they are SDK modules as opposed to interfaces.

The tendermint and solo machine clients were refactored to include this AppModuleBasic implementation and core IBC will no longer include either type as registered by default. Longer term solutions include using internal module communication as described in ADR 033 on the SDK. The following functions should become callbacks invoked via intermodule communication: Status GetTimestampAtHeight VerifyMembership VerifyNonMembership Initialize VerifyClientMessage CheckForMisbehaviour UpdateStateOnMisbehaviour UpdateState CheckSubstituteAndUpdateState VerifyUpgradeAndUpdateState The ClientState interface should eventually be trimmed down to something along the lines of: type ClientState interface { proto.Message ClientType() string GetLatestHeight() Height Validate() error ZeroCustomFields() ClientState // ADDITION Route() string // route used for intermodule communication } For the most part, any functions which require access to the client store should likely not be an interface function of the ClientState.

We wish to expand this \"naive\" strategy to a \"passive\" one which detects and relays both channel handshake messages and packets on a given connection, without the need to know each channel in advance of relaying it. In order to accomplish this, we propose adding more comprehensive events to expose channel metadata for each transaction sent from the x/ibc/core/04-channel/keeper/handshake.go and x/ibc/core/04-channel/keeper/packet.go modules.

Here is how this callback would be used, in the implementation of x/ibc/handler.go: // ... case channel.MsgChannelOpenTry: // Lookup module by port capability module, portCap, err := k.PortKeeper.LookupModuleByPort(ctx, msg.PortID) if err != nil { return nil, sdkerrors.Wrap(err, \"could not retrieve module from port-id\") } // Retrieve callbacks from router cbs, ok := k.Router.GetRoute(module) if !ok { return nil, sdkerrors.Wrapf(port.ErrInvalidRoute, \"route not found to module: %s\", module) } // Delegate to the module's OnAttemptChanOpenTry. return cbs.OnAttemptChanOpenTry(ctx, k.ChannelKeeper, portCap, msg) The reason we do not have a more structured interaction between x/ibc/handler.go and the port's module (to explicitly negotiate versions, etc) is that we do not wish to constrain the app module to have to finish handling the MsgChannelOpenTry during this transaction or even this block.","s":"Handling Channel Open Attempts","u":"/architecture/adr-025-ibc-passive-channels/","h":"/architecture/adr-025-ibc-passive-channels/#handling-channel-open-attempts","p":1390},{"i":1400,"t":"Expose events to allow \"passive\" connection relayers.

Adding support for new light clients or updating an existing light client in the event of a security issue or consensus update is a multi-step process which is both time-consuming and error-prone. In order to enable new IBC light client implementations it is necessary to modify the codebase of ibc-go (if the light client is part of its codebase), re-build chains' binaries, pass a governance proposal and validators upgrade their nodes. Another problem stemming from the above process is that if a chain wants to upgrade its own consensus, it will need to convince every chain or hub connected to it to upgrade its light client in order to stay connected. Due to the time-consuming process required to upgrade a light client, a chain with lots of connections needs to be disconnected for quite some time after upgrading its consensus, which can be very expensive in terms of time and effort. We are proposing simplifying this workflow by integrating a Wasm light client module that makes adding support for new light clients a simple governance-gated transaction. The light client bytecode, written in Wasm-compilable Rust, runs inside a Wasm VM. The Wasm light client submodule exposes a proxy light client interface that routes incoming messages to the appropriate handler function, inside the Wasm VM for execution. With the Wasm light client module, anybody can add new IBC light client in the form of Wasm bytecode (provided they are able to submit the governance proposal transaction and that it passes) as well as instantiate clients using any created client type.

Create a new Msg with two client identifiers (string) and a signer. The first client identifier is the proposed client to be updated. This client must be either frozen or expired. The second client is a substitute client. It carries all the state for the client which may be updated. It must have identical client and chain parameters to the client which may be updated (except for latest height, frozen height, and chain-id). It should be continually updated during the voting period. If this governance proposal passes, the client on trial will be updated to the latest state of the substitute. The signer must be the authority set for the ibc module. Previously, AllowUpdateAfterExpiry and AllowUpdateAfterMisbehaviour were used to signal the recovery options for an expired or frozen client, and governance proposals were not allowed to overwrite the client if these parameters were set to false. However, this has now been deprecated because a code migration can overwrite the client and consensus states regardless of the value of these parameters. If governance would vote to overwrite a client or consensus state, it is likely that governance would also be willing to perform a code migration to do the same. In addition, TrustingPeriod was initially not allowed to be updated by a client upgrade proposal. However, due to the number of situations experienced in production where the TrustingPeriod of a client should be allowed to be updated because of ie: initial misconfiguration for a canonical channel, governance should be allowed to update this client parameter. In versions older than ibc-go v8, MsgRecoverClient was a governance proposal type ClientUpdateProposal. It has been removed and replaced by MsgRecoverClient in the migration from governance v1beta1 to governance v1. Note that this should NOT be lightly updated, as there may be a gap in time between when misbehaviour has occurred and when the evidence of misbehaviour is submitted. For example, if the UnbondingPeriod is 2 weeks and the TrustingPeriod has also been set to two weeks, a validator could wait until right before UnbondingPeriod finishes, submit false information, then unbond and exit without being slashed for misbehaviour. Therefore, we recommend that the trusting period for the 07-tendermint client be set to 2/3 of the UnbondingPeriod. Note that clients frozen due to misbehaviour must wait for the evidence to expire to avoid becoming refrozen.

In ICS 26, the routing module is defined as a layer above each application module which verifies and routes messages to the destination modules. It is possible to implement it as a separate module, however, we already have the functionality to route messages upon the destination identifiers in the baseapp. This ADR suggests to utilize existing baseapp.router to route packets to application modules. Generally, routing module callbacks have two separate steps in them, verification and execution. This corresponds to the AnteHandler-Handler model inside the SDK. We can do the verification inside the AnteHandler in order to increase developer ergonomics by reducing boilerplate verification code. For atomic multi-message transaction, we want to keep the IBC related state modification to be preserved even the application side state change reverts. One of the example might be IBC token sending message following with stake delegation which uses the tokens received by the previous packet message. If the token receiving fails for any reason, we might not want to keep executing the transaction, but we also don't want to abort the transaction or the sequence and commitment will be reverted and the channel will be stuck. This ADR suggests new CodeType, CodeTxBreak, to fix this problem.","s":"Context","u":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/","h":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/#context","p":1587},{"i":1593,"t":"PortKeeper will have the capability key that is able to access only the channels bound to the port. Entities that hold a PortKeeper will be able to call the methods on it which are corresponding with the methods with the same names on the ChannelKeeper, but only with the allowed port. ChannelKeeper.Port(string, ChannelChecker) will be defined to easily construct a capability-safe PortKeeper. This will be addressed in another ADR and we will use insecure ChannelKeeper for now. baseapp.runMsgs will break the loop over the messages if one of the handlers returns !Result.IsOK(). However, the outer logic will write the cached store if Result.IsOK() || Result.Code.IsBreak(). Result.Code.IsBreak() if Result.Code == CodeTxBreak. func (app *BaseApp) runTx(tx Tx) (result Result) { msgs := tx.GetMsgs() // AnteHandler if app.anteHandler != nil { anteCtx, msCache := app.cacheTxContext(ctx) newCtx, err := app.anteHandler(anteCtx, tx) if !newCtx.IsZero() { ctx = newCtx.WithMultiStore(ms) } if err != nil { // error handling logic return res } msCache.Write() } // Main Handler runMsgCtx, msCache := app.cacheTxContext(ctx) result = app.runMsgs(runMsgCtx, msgs) // BEGIN modification made in this ADR if result.IsOK() || result.IsBreak() { // END msCache.Write() } return result } The Cosmos SDK will define an AnteDecorator for IBC packet receiving. The AnteDecorator will iterate over the messages included in the transaction, type switch to check whether the message contains an incoming IBC packet, and if so verify the Merkle proof. type ProofVerificationDecorator struct { clientKeeper ClientKeeper channelKeeper ChannelKeeper } func (pvr ProofVerificationDecorator) AnteHandle(ctx Context, tx Tx, simulate bool, next AnteHandler) (Context, error) { for _, msg := range tx.GetMsgs() { var err error switch msg := msg.(type) { case client.MsgUpdateClient: err = pvr.clientKeeper.UpdateClient(msg.ClientID, msg.Header) case channel.MsgPacket: err = pvr.channelKeeper.RecvPacket(msg.Packet, msg.Proofs, msg.ProofHeight) case channel.MsgAcknowledgement: err = pvr.channelKeeper.AcknowledgementPacket(msg.Acknowledgement, msg.Proof, msg.ProofHeight) case channel.MsgTimeoutPacket: err = pvr.channelKeeper.TimeoutPacket(msg.Packet, msg.Proof, msg.ProofHeight, msg.NextSequenceRecv) case channel.MsgChannelOpenInit; err = pvr.channelKeeper.CheckOpen(msg.PortID, msg.ChannelID, msg.Channel) default: continue } if err != nil { return ctx, err } } return next(ctx, tx, simulate) } Where MsgUpdateClient, MsgPacket, MsgAcknowledgement, MsgTimeoutPacket are sdk.Msg types correspond to handleUpdateClient, handleRecvPacket, handleAcknowledgementPacket, handleTimeoutPacket of the routing module, respectively. The side effects of RecvPacket, VerifyAcknowledgement, VerifyTimeout will be extracted out into separated functions, WriteAcknowledgement, DeleteCommitment, DeleteCommitmentTimeout, respectively, which will be called by the application handlers after the execution. WriteAcknowledgement writes the acknowledgement to the state that can be verified by the counter-party chain and increments the sequence to prevent double execution. DeleteCommitment will delete the commitment stored, DeleteCommitmentTimeout will delete the commitment and close channel in case of ordered channel. func (keeper ChannelKeeper) WriteAcknowledgement(ctx Context, packet Packet, ack []byte) { keeper.SetPacketAcknowledgement(ctx, packet.GetDestPort(), packet.GetDestChannel(), packet.GetSequence(), ack) keeper.SetNextSequenceRecv(ctx, packet.GetDestPort(), packet.GetDestChannel(), packet.GetSequence()) } func (keeper ChannelKeeper) DeleteCommitment(ctx Context, packet Packet) { keeper.deletePacketCommitment(ctx, packet.GetSourcePort(), packet.GetSourceChannel(), packet.GetSequence()) } func (keeper ChannelKeeper) DeleteCommitmentTimeout(ctx Context, packet Packet) { k.deletePacketCommitment(ctx, packet.GetSourcePort(), packet.GetSourceChannel(), packet.GetSequence()) if channel.Ordering == types.ORDERED [ channel.State = types.CLOSED k.SetChannel(ctx, packet.GetSourcePort(), packet.GetSourceChannel(), channel) } } Each application handler should call respective finalization methods on the PortKeeper in order to increase sequence (in case of packet) or remove the commitment (in case of acknowledgement and timeout). Calling those functions implies that the application logic has successfully executed. However, the handlers can return Result with CodeTxBreak after calling those methods which will persist the state changes that has been already done but prevent any further messages to be executed in case of semantically invalid packet. This will keep the sequence increased in the previous IBC packets(thus preventing double execution) without proceeding to the following messages. In any case the application modules should never return state reverting result, which will make the channel unable to proceed. ChannelKeeper.CheckOpen method will be introduced. This will replace onChanOpen* defined under the routing module specification. Instead of define each channel handshake callback functions, application modules can provide ChannelChecker function with the AppModule which will be injected to ChannelKeeper.Port() at the top level application. CheckOpen will find the correct ChannelChecker using the PortID and call it, which will return an error if it is unacceptable by the application. The ProofVerificationDecorator will be inserted to the top level application. It is not safe to make each module responsible to call proof verification logic, whereas application can misbehave(in terms of IBC protocol) by mistake. The ProofVerificationDecorator should come right after the default sybil attack resistant layer from the current auth.NewAnteHandler: // add IBC ProofVerificationDecorator to the Chain of func NewAnteHandler( ak keeper.AccountKeeper, supplyKeeper types.SupplyKeeper, ibcKeeper ibc.Keeper, sigGasConsumer SignatureVerificationGasConsumer) sdk.AnteHandler { return sdk.ChainAnteDecorators( NewSetUpContextDecorator(), // outermost AnteDecorator. SetUpContext must be called first ... NewIncrementSequenceDecorator(ak), ibcante.ProofVerificationDecorator(ibcKeeper.ClientKeeper, ibcKeeper.ChannelKeeper), // innermost AnteDecorator ) } The implementation of this ADR will also create a Data field of the Packet of type []byte, which can be deserialised by the receiving module into its own private type. It is up to the application modules to do this according to their own interpretation, not by the IBC keeper. This is crucial for dynamic IBC. Example application-side usage: type AppModule struct {} // CheckChannel will be provided to the ChannelKeeper as ChannelKeeper.Port(module.CheckChannel) func (module AppModule) CheckChannel(portID, channelID string, channel Channel) error { if channel.Ordering != UNORDERED { return ErrUncompatibleOrdering() } if channel.CounterpartyPort != \"bank\" { return ErrUncompatiblePort() } if channel.Version != \"\" { return ErrUncompatibleVersion() } return nil } func NewHandler(k Keeper) Handler { return func(ctx Context, msg Msg) Result { switch msg := msg.(type) { case MsgTransfer: return handleMsgTransfer(ctx, k, msg) case ibc.MsgPacket: var data PacketDataTransfer if err := types.ModuleCodec.UnmarshalBinaryBare(msg.GetData(), &data); err != nil { return err } return handlePacketDataTransfer(ctx, k, msg, data) case ibc.MsgTimeoutPacket: var data PacketDataTransfer if err := types.ModuleCodec.UnmarshalBinaryBare(msg.GetData(), &data); err != nil { return err } return handleTimeoutPacketDataTransfer(ctx, k, packet) // interface { PortID() string; ChannelID() string; Channel() ibc.Channel } // MsgChanInit, MsgChanTry implements ibc.MsgChannelOpen case ibc.MsgChannelOpen: return handleMsgChannelOpen(ctx, k, msg) } } } func handleMsgTransfer(ctx Context, k Keeper, msg MsgTransfer) Result { err := k.SendTransfer(ctx,msg.PortID, msg.ChannelID, msg.Amount, msg.Sender, msg.Receiver) if err != nil { return sdk.ResultFromError(err) } return sdk.Result{} } func handlePacketDataTransfer(ctx Context, k Keeper, packet Packet, data PacketDataTransfer) Result { err := k.ReceiveTransfer(ctx, packet.GetSourcePort(), packet.GetSourceChannel(), packet.GetDestinationPort(), packet.GetDestinationChannel(), data) if err != nil { // TODO: Source chain sent invalid packet, shutdown channel } k.ChannelKeeper.WriteAcknowledgement([]byte{0x00}) // WriteAcknowledgement increases the sequence, preventing double spending return sdk.Result{} } func handleCustomTimeoutPacket(ctx Context, k Keeper, packet CustomPacket) Result { err := k.RecoverTransfer(ctx, packet.GetSourcePort(), packet.GetSourceChannel(), packet.GetDestinationPort(), packet.GetDestinationChannel(), data) if err != nil { // This chain sent invalid packet or cannot recover the funds panic(err) } k.ChannelKeeper.DeleteCommitmentTimeout(ctx, packet) // packet timeout should not fail return sdk.Result{} } func handleMsgChannelOpen(sdk.Context, k Keeper, msg MsgOpenChannel) Result { k.AllocateEscrowAddress(ctx, msg.ChannelID()) return sdk.Result{} }","s":"Decision","u":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/","h":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/#decision","p":1587},{"i":1595,"t":"Proposed","s":"Status","u":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/","h":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/#status","p":1587},{"i":1598,"t":"Intuitive interface for developers - IBC handlers do not need to care about IBC authentication State change commitment logic is embedded into baseapp.runTx logic","s":"Positive","u":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/","h":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/#positive","p":1587},{"i":1600,"t":"Cannot support dynamic ports, routing is tied to the baseapp router","s":"Negative","u":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/","h":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/#negative","p":1587},{"i":1602,"t":"Introduces new AnteHandler decorator.

Looking for information on ibc-rs? Click here to go to the ibc-rs github repo. The Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) is an end-to-end, connection-oriented, stateful protocol for reliable, ordered, and authenticated communication between heterogeneous blockchains arranged in an unknown and dynamic topology. IBC is a protocol that allows blockchains to talk to each other. Chains that speak IBC can share any type of data as long as it's encoded in bytes, enabling the industry’s most feature-rich cross-chain interactions. IBC is secure and permissionless. The protocol realizes this interoperability by specifying a set of data structures, abstractions, and semantics that can be implemented by any distributed ledger that satisfies a small set of requirements. IBC can be used to build a wide range of cross-chain applications that include token transfers, atomic swaps, multi-chain smart contracts (with or without mutually comprehensible VMs), cross-chain account control, and data and code sharding of various kinds.","s":"IBC-Go Documentation","u":"/v8/","h":"","p":1662},{"i":1665,"t":"The following diagram shows how IBC works at a high level: The transport layer (TAO) provides the necessary infrastructure to establish secure connections and authenticate data packets between chains. The application layer builds on top of the transport layer and defines exactly how data packets should be packaged and interpreted by the sending and receiving chains. IBC provides a reliable, permissionless, and generic base layer (allowing for the secure relaying of data packets), while allowing for composability and modularity with separation of concerns by moving application designs (interpreting and acting upon the packet data) to a higher-level layer. This separation is reflected in the categories: IBC/TAO comprises the Transport, Authentication, and Ordering of packets, i.e. the infrastructure layer. IBC/APP consists of the application handlers for the data packets being passed over the transport layer. These include but are not limited to fungible token transfers (ICS-20), NFT transfers (ICS-721), and interchain accounts (ICS-27). Application module: groups any application, middleware or smart contract that may wrap downsteam application handlers to provide enhanced functionality. Note three crucial elements in the diagram: The chains depend on relayers to communicate. Relayers are the \"physical\" connection layer of IBC: off-chain processes responsible for relaying data between two chains running the IBC protocol by scanning the state of each chain, constructing appropriate datagrams, and executing them on the opposite chain as is allowed by the protocol. Many relayers can serve one or more channels to send messages between the chains. Each side of the connection uses the light client of the other chain to quickly verify incoming messages.","s":"High-level overview of IBC","u":"/v8/","h":"/v8/#high-level-overview-of-ibc","p":1662},{"i":1667,"t":"The Interchain Accounts module uses either ORDERED or UNORDERED channels. When using ORDERED channels, the order of transactions when sending packets from a controller to a host chain is maintained. When using UNORDERED channels, there is no guarantee that the order of transactions when sending packets from the controller to the host chain is maintained. Since ibc-go v8.3.0, the default ordering for new ICA channels is UNORDERED, if no ordering is specified in MsgRegisterInterchainAccount (previously the default ordering was ORDERED). A limitation when using ORDERED channels is that when a packet times out the channel will be closed. In the case of a channel closing, a controller chain needs to be able to regain access to the interchain account registered on this channel. Active Channels enable this functionality. When an Interchain Account is registered using MsgRegisterInterchainAccount, a new channel is created on a particular port. During the OnChanOpenAck and OnChanOpenConfirm steps (on controller & host chain respectively) the Active Channel for this interchain account is stored in state. It is possible to create a new channel using the same controller chain portID if the previously set Active Channel is now in a CLOSED state. This channel creation can be initialized programmatically by sending a new MsgChannelOpenInit message like so: msg := channeltypes.NewMsgChannelOpenInit(portID, string(versionBytes), channeltypes.ORDERED, []string{connectionID}, icatypes.HostPortID, authtypes.NewModuleAddress(icatypes.ModuleName).String()) handler := keeper.msgRouter.Handler(msg) res, err := handler(ctx, msg) if err != nil { return err } Alternatively, any relayer operator may initiate a new channel handshake for this interchain account once the previously set Active Channel is in a CLOSED state. This is done by initiating the channel handshake on the controller chain using the same portID associated with the interchain account in question. It is important to note that once a channel has been opened for a given interchain account, new channels can not be opened for this account until the currently set Active Channel is set to CLOSED.","s":"Understanding Active Channels","u":"/v8/apps/interchain-accounts/active-channels/","h":"","p":1666},{"i":1669,"t":"Future versions of the ICS-27 protocol and the Interchain Accounts module will likely use a new channel type that provides ordering of packets without the channel closing in the event of a packet timing out, thus removing the need for Active Channels entirely.

Thus the purpose of the authentication module is to wrap the controller submodule with custom authentication logic. In ibc-go, authentication modules can communicate with the controller submodule by passing messages through baseapp's MsgServiceRouter. To implement an authentication module, the IBCModule interface need not be fulfilled; it is only required to fulfill Cosmos SDK's AppModuleBasic interface, just like any regular Cosmos SDK application module.

Synopsis Authentication modules play the role of the Base Application as described in ICS-30 IBC Middleware, and enable application developers to perform custom logic when working with the Interchain Accounts controller API. The controller submodule is used for account registration and packet sending. It executes only logic required of all controllers of interchain accounts. The type of authentication used to manage the interchain accounts remains unspecified. There may exist many different types of authentication which are desirable for different use cases. Thus the purpose of the authentication module is to wrap the controller submodule with custom authentication logic. In ibc-go, authentication modules are connected to the controller chain via a middleware stack. The controller submodule is implemented as middleware and the authentication module is connected to the controller submodule as the base application of the middleware stack. To implement an authentication module, the IBCModule interface must be fulfilled. By implementing the controller submodule as middleware, any amount of authentication modules can be created and connected to the controller submodule without writing redundant code. The authentication module must: Authenticate interchain account owners. Track the associated interchain account address for an owner. Send packets on behalf of an owner (after authentication). Please note that since ibc-go v6 the channel capability is claimed by the controller submodule and therefore it is not required for authentication modules to claim the capability in the OnChanOpenInit callback. When the authentication module sends packets on the channel created for the associated interchain account it can pass a nil capability to the legacy function SendTx of the controller keeper (see section SendTx for more information).","s":"Deprecation Notice","u":"/v8/apps/interchain-accounts/legacy/auth-modules/","h":"/v8/apps/interchain-accounts/legacy/auth-modules/#deprecation-notice","p":1697},{"i":1701,"t":"The following IBCModule callbacks must be implemented with appropriate custom logic: // OnChanOpenInit implements the IBCModule interface func (im IBCModule) OnChanOpenInit( ctx sdk.Context, order channeltypes.Order, connectionHops []string, portID string, channelID string, chanCap *capabilitytypes.Capability, counterparty channeltypes.Counterparty, version string, ) (string, error) { // since ibc-go v6 the authentication module *must not* claim the channel capability on OnChanOpenInit // perform custom logic return version, nil } // OnChanOpenAck implements the IBCModule interface func (im IBCModule) OnChanOpenAck( ctx sdk.Context, portID, channelID string, counterpartyVersion string, ) error { // perform custom logic return nil } // OnChanCloseConfirm implements the IBCModule interface func (im IBCModule) OnChanCloseConfirm( ctx sdk.Context, portID, channelID string, ) error { // perform custom logic return nil } // OnAcknowledgementPacket implements the IBCModule interface func (im IBCModule) OnAcknowledgementPacket( ctx sdk.Context, packet channeltypes.Packet, acknowledgement []byte, relayer sdk.AccAddress, ) error { // perform custom logic return nil } // OnTimeoutPacket implements the IBCModule interface. func (im IBCModule) OnTimeoutPacket( ctx sdk.Context, packet channeltypes.Packet, relayer sdk.AccAddress, ) error { // perform custom logic return nil } The following functions must be defined to fulfill the IBCModule interface, but they will never be called by the controller submodule so they may error or panic.

The following document only applies for Cosmos SDK chains. The Interchain Accounts module contains two submodules. Each submodule has its own IBC application. The Interchain Accounts module should be registered as an AppModule in the same way all SDK modules are registered on a chain, but each submodule should create its own IBCModule as necessary. A route should be added to the IBC router for each submodule which will be used. Chains who wish to support ICS-27 may elect to act as a host chain, a controller chain or both. Disabling host or controller functionality may be done statically by excluding the host or controller submodule entirely from the app.go file or it may be done dynamically by taking advantage of the on-chain parameters which enable or disable the host or controller submodules. Interchain Account authentication modules (both custom or generic, such as the x/gov, x/group or x/auth Cosmos SDK modules) can send messages to the controller submodule's MsgServer to register interchain accounts and send packets to the interchain account. To accomplish this, the authentication module needs to be composed with baseapp's MsgServiceRouter. Please note that since ibc-go v8.3.0 it is mandatory to register the gRPC query router after the creation of the host submodule's keeper; otherwise, nodes will not start.

Synopsis Learn how to integrate Interchain Accounts host and controller functionality to your chain. The following document only applies for Cosmos SDK chains. The Interchain Accounts module contains two submodules. Each submodule has its own IBC application. The Interchain Accounts module should be registered as an AppModule in the same way all SDK modules are registered on a chain, but each submodule should create its own IBCModule as necessary. A route should be added to the IBC router for each submodule which will be used. Chains who wish to support ICS-27 may elect to act as a host chain, a controller chain or both. Disabling host or controller functionality may be done statically by excluding the host or controller module entirely from the app.go file or it may be done dynamically by taking advantage of the on-chain parameters which enable or disable the host or controller submodules. Interchain Account authentication modules are the base application of a middleware stack. The controller submodule is the middleware in this stack. Please note that since ibc-go v6 the channel capability is claimed by the controller submodule and therefore it is not required for authentication modules to claim the capability in the OnChanOpenInit callback. Therefore the custom authentication module does not need a scoped keeper anymore. Please note that since ibc-go v8.3.0 it is mandatory to register the gRPC query router after the creation of the host submodule's keeper; otherwise, nodes will not start. The query router is used to execute on the host query messages encoded in the ICA packet data. Please check the sample integration code below for more details.","s":"Deprecation Notice","u":"/v8/apps/interchain-accounts/legacy/integration/","h":"/v8/apps/interchain-accounts/legacy/integration/#deprecation-notice","p":1758},{"i":1762,"t":"// app.go // Register the AppModule for the Interchain Accounts module and the authentication module // Note: No `icaauth` exists, this must be substituted with an actual Interchain Accounts authentication module ModuleBasics = module.NewBasicManager( ... ica.AppModuleBasic{}, icaauth.AppModuleBasic{}, ... ) ... // Add module account permissions for the Interchain Accounts module // Only necessary for host chain functionality // Each Interchain Account created on the host chain is derived from the module account created maccPerms = map[string][]string{ ... icatypes.ModuleName: nil, } ... // Add Interchain Accounts Keepers for each submodule used and the authentication module // If a submodule is being statically disabled, the associated Keeper does not need to be added. type App struct { ...

Query the client state using the identifiers pair. Note that this query will return a \"Not Found\" response if the current chain is not connected to this channel. Retrieve the client identifier or chain identifier from the client state (eg: on Tendermint clients) and store it locally. Using the gRPC gateway client service the steps above would be, with a given IBC token ibc/7F1D3FCF4AE79E1554D670D1AD949A9BA4E4A3C76C63093E17E446A46061A7A2 stored on chainB: GET /ibc/apps/transfer/v1/denom_traces/7F1D3FCF4AE79E1554D670D1AD949A9BA4E4A3C76C63093E17E446A46061A7A2 -> {\"path\": \"transfer/channelToA\", \"base_denom\": \"uatom\"} GET /ibc/apps/transfer/v1/channels/channelToA/ports/transfer/client_state\" -> {\"client_id\": \"clientA\", \"chain-id\": \"chainA\", ...} GET /ibc/apps/transfer/v1/channels/channelToA/ports/transfer\" -> {\"channel_id\": \"channelToA\", port_id\": \"transfer\", counterparty: {\"channel_id\": \"channelToB\", port_id\": \"transfer\"}, ...} GET /ibc/apps/transfer/v1/channels/channelToB/ports/transfer/client_state\" -> {\"client_id\": \"clientB\", \"chain-id\": \"chainB\", ...} Then, the token transfer chain path for the uatom denomination would be: chainA -> chainB.","s":"Direct connection","u":"/v8/apps/transfer/overview/","h":"/v8/apps/transfer/overview/#direct-connection","p":1783},{"i":1797,"t":"The multiple channel hops case applies when the token has passed through multiple chains between the original source and final destination chains. The IBC protocol doesn't know the topology of the overall network (i.e connections between chains and identifier names between them). For this reason, in the multiple hops case, a particular chain in the timeline of the individual transfers can't query the chain and client identifiers of the other chains. Take for example the following sequence of transfers A -> B -> C for an IBC token, with a final prefix path (trace info) of transfer/channelChainC/transfer/channelChainB. What the paragraph above means is that even in the case that chain C is directly connected to chain A, querying the port and channel identifiers that chain B uses to connect to chain A (eg: transfer/channelChainA) can be completely different from the one that chain C uses to connect to chain A (eg: transfer/channelToChainA). Thus the proposed solution for clients that the IBC team recommends are the following: Connect to all chains: Connecting to all the chains in the timeline would allow clients to perform the queries outlined in the direct connection section to each relevant chain. By repeatedly following the port and channel denomination trace transfer timeline, clients should always be able to find all the relevant identifiers. This comes at the tradeoff that the client must connect to nodes on each of the chains in order to perform the queries. Relayer as a Service (RaaS): A longer term solution is to use/create a relayer service that could map the denomination trace to the chain path timeline for each token (i.e origin chain -> chain #1 -> ... -> chain #(n-1) -> final chain). These services could provide merkle proofs in order to allow clients to optionally verify the path timeline correctness for themselves by running light clients. If the proofs are not verified, they should be considered as trusted third parties services. Additionally, client would be advised in the future to use RaaS that support the largest number of connections between chains in the ecosystem. Unfortunately, none of the existing public relayers (in Golang and Rust), provide this service to clients. tip The only viable alternative for clients (at the time of writing) to tokens with multiple connection hops, is to connect to all chains directly and perform relevant queries to each of them in the sequence.","s":"Multiple hops","u":"/v8/apps/transfer/overview/","h":"/v8/apps/transfer/overview/#multiple-hops","p":1783},{"i":1799,"t":"In some exceptional cases, a client state associated with a given channel cannot be updated.

Once the proposal passes the client state will be unfrozen and the funds from the associated channels will then be unlocked. This mechanism only applies to clients that allow updates via governance, such as Tendermint clients. In addition to this, it's important to mention that a token must be sent back along the exact route that it took originally in order to return it to its original form on the source chain (eg: the Cosmos Hub for the uatom).

Upon realization of the ability for middleware's to define their own packet data types, this interface will be deprecated and removed with time. type PacketDataProvider interface { // GetCustomPacketData returns the packet data held on behalf of another application. // The name the information is stored under should be provided as the key. // If no custom packet data exists for the key, nil should be returned. GetCustomPacketData(key string) interface{} } The implementation of GetCustomPacketData should return packet data held on behalf of another application (if present and supported). If this functionality is not supported, it should return nil. Otherwise it should return the packet data associated with the provided key. This interface gives IBC applications access to the packet data information embedded into the base packet data type. Within transfer and interchain accounts, the embedded packet data is stored within the Memo field. Once all IBC applications within an IBC stack are capable of creating/maintaining their own packet data type's, this interface function will be deprecated and removed.","s":"Optional interfaces","u":"/v8/ibc/apps/packets_acks/","h":"/v8/ibc/apps/packets_acks/#optional-interfaces","p":1861},{"i":1870,"t":"Modules may commit an acknowledgement upon receiving and processing a packet in the case of synchronous packet processing.

This interface contains all of the callbacks IBC expects modules to implement. This section will describe the callbacks that are called during channel handshake execution.

Closing a channel is a 2-step handshake, the initiating chain calls ChanCloseInit and the finalizing chain calls ChanCloseConfirm. // Called by IBC Handler on MsgCloseInit OnChanCloseInit( ctx sdk.Context, portID, channelID string, ) error { // ... do custom finalization logic // Use above arguments to determine if we want to abort handshake err := checkArguments(args) return err } // Called by IBC Handler on MsgCloseConfirm OnChanCloseConfirm( ctx sdk.Context, portID, channelID string, ) error { // ... do custom finalization logic // Use above arguments to determine if we want to abort handshake err := checkArguments(args) return err } Channel Handshake Version Negotiation​ Application modules are expected to verify versioning used during the channel handshake procedure. ChanOpenInit callback should verify that the MsgChanOpenInit.Version is valid ChanOpenTry callback should construct the application version used for both channel ends. If no application version can be constructed, it must return an error. ChanOpenAck callback should verify that the MsgChanOpenAck.CounterpartyVersion is valid and supported. IBC expects application modules to perform application version negotiation in OnChanOpenTry. The negotiated version must be returned to core IBC. If the version cannot be negotiated, an error should be returned. Versions must be strings but can implement any versioning structure. If your application plans to have linear releases then semantic versioning is recommended. If your application plans to release various features in between major releases then it is advised to use the same versioning scheme as IBC. This versioning scheme specifies a version identifier and compatible feature set with that identifier. Valid version selection includes selecting a compatible version identifier with a subset of features supported by your application for that version. The struct is used for this scheme can be found in 03-connection/types. Since the version type is a string, applications have the ability to do simple version verification via string matching or they can use the already implemented versioning system and pass the proto encoded version into each handhshake call as necessary.

This process is not specified by IBC as it is up to each application module to determine how to implement this agreement. However, for most applications this will happen as a version negotiation during the channel handshake. While more complex version negotiation is possible to implement inside the channel opening handshake, a very simple version negotiation is implemented in the ibc-transfer module. Thus, a module must define its custom packet data structure, along with a well-defined way to encode and decode it to and from []byte. // Custom packet data defined in application module type CustomPacketData struct { // Custom fields ... } EncodePacketData(packetData CustomPacketData) []byte { // encode packetData to bytes } DecodePacketData(encoded []byte) (CustomPacketData) { // decode from bytes to packet data } Then a module must encode its packet data before sending it through IBC. // retrieve the dynamic capability for this channel channelCap := scopedKeeper.GetCapability(ctx, channelCapName) // Sending custom application packet data data := EncodePacketData(customPacketData) packet.Data = data // Send packet to IBC, authenticating with channelCap sequence, err := IBCChannelKeeper.SendPacket( ctx, channelCap, sourcePort, sourceChannel, timeoutHeight, timeoutTimestamp, data, ) A module receiving a packet must decode the PacketData into a structure it expects so that it can act on it. // Receiving custom application packet data (in OnRecvPacket) packetData := DecodePacketData(packet.Data) // handle received custom packet data Packet Flow Handling​ Just as IBC expected modules to implement callbacks for channel handshakes, IBC also expects modules to implement callbacks for handling the packet flow through a channel. Once a module A and module B are connected to each other, relayers can start relaying packets and acknowledgements back and forth on the channel. Briefly, a successful packet flow works as follows: module A sends a packet through the IBC module the packet is received by module B if module B writes an acknowledgement of the packet then module A will process the acknowledgement if the packet is not successfully received before the timeout, then module A processes the packet's timeout. Sending Packets​ Modules do not send packets through callbacks, since the modules initiate the action of sending packets to the IBC module, as opposed to other parts of the packet flow where msgs sent to the IBC module must trigger execution on the port-bound module through the use of callbacks. Thus, to send a packet a module simply needs to call SendPacket on the IBCChannelKeeper. // retrieve the dynamic capability for this channel channelCap := scopedKeeper.GetCapability(ctx, channelCapName) // Sending custom application packet data data := EncodePacketData(customPacketData) // Send packet to IBC, authenticating with channelCap sequence, err := IBCChannelKeeper.SendPacket( ctx, channelCap, sourcePort, sourceChannel, timeoutHeight, timeoutTimestamp, data, ) warning In order to prevent modules from sending packets on channels they do not own, IBC expects modules to pass in the correct channel capability for the packet's source channel. Receiving Packets​ To handle receiving packets, the module must implement the OnRecvPacket callback. This gets invoked by the IBC module after the packet has been proved valid and correctly processed by the IBC keepers. Thus, the OnRecvPacket callback only needs to worry about making the appropriate state changes given the packet data without worrying about whether the packet is valid or not. Modules may return to the IBC handler an acknowledgement which implements the Acknowledgement interface. The IBC handler will then commit this acknowledgement of the packet so that a relayer may relay the acknowledgement back to the sender module. The state changes that occurred during this callback will only be written if: the acknowledgement was successful as indicated by the Success() function of the acknowledgement if the acknowledgement returned is nil indicating that an asynchronous process is occurring NOTE: Applications which process asynchronous acknowledgements must handle reverting state changes when appropriate. Any state changes that occurred during the OnRecvPacket callback will be written for asynchronous acknowledgements.

The sender module can then process the acknowledgement using the OnAcknowledgementPacket callback. The contents of the acknowledgement is entirely up to the modules on the channel (just like the packet data); however, it may often contain information on whether the packet was successfully processed along with some additional data that could be useful for remediation if the packet processing failed. Since the modules are responsible for agreeing on an encoding/decoding standard for packet data and acknowledgements, IBC will pass in the acknowledgements as []byte to this callback. The callback is responsible for decoding the acknowledgement and processing it.

Thus, the sending chain must process the timeout using OnTimeoutPacket to handle this situation.

Channel upgradability is an IBC-level protocol that allows chains to leverage new application and channel features without having to create new channels or perform a network-wide upgrade. Prior to this feature, developers who wanted to update an application module or add a middleware to their application flow would need to create a new channel in order to use the updated application feature/middleware, resulting in a loss of the accumulated state/liquidity, token fungibility (as the channel ID is encoded in the IBC denom), and any other larger network effects of losing usage of the existing channel from relayers monitoring, etc. With channel upgradability, applications will be able to implement features such as but not limited to: potentially adding denom metadata to tokens, or utilizing the fee middleware, all while maintaining the channels on which they currently operate. This document outlines the channel upgrade feature, and the multiple steps used in the upgrade process.","s":"Channel Upgrades","u":"/v8/ibc/channel-upgrades/","h":"","p":1959},{"i":1962,"t":"Channel upgrades will be achieved using a handshake process that is designed to be similar to the standard connection/channel opening handshake. type Channel struct { // current state of the channel end State State `protobuf:\"varint,1,opt,name=state,proto3,enum=ibc.core.channel.v1.State\" json:\"state,omitempty\"` // whether the channel is ordered or unordered Ordering Order `protobuf:\"varint,2,opt,name=ordering,proto3,enum=ibc.core.channel.v1.Order\" json:\"ordering,omitempty\"` // counterparty channel end Counterparty Counterparty `protobuf:\"bytes,3,opt,name=counterparty,proto3\" json:\"counterparty\"` // list of connection identifiers, in order, along which packets sent on // this channel will travel ConnectionHops []string `protobuf:\"bytes,4,rep,name=connection_hops,json=connectionHops,proto3\" json:\"connection_hops,omitempty\"` // opaque channel version, which is agreed upon during the handshake Version string `protobuf:\"bytes,5,opt,name=version,proto3\" json:\"version,omitempty\"` // upgrade sequence indicates the latest upgrade attempt performed by this channel // the value of 0 indicates the channel has never been upgraded UpgradeSequence uint64 `protobuf:\"varint,6,opt,name=upgrade_sequence,json=upgradeSequence,proto3\" json:\"upgrade_sequence,omitempty\"` } The version, connection hops, and channel ordering are fields in this channel struct which can be changed.

However, although connection hops can change in a channel upgrade, both sides must still be each other's counterparty. This is enforced by the upgrade protocol and upgrade attempts which try to alter an expected counterparty will fail. On a high level, successful handshake process for channel upgrades works as follows: The chain initiating the upgrade process will propose an upgrade. If the counterparty agrees with the proposal, it will block sends and begin flushing any in-flight packets on its channel end. This flushing process will be covered in more detail below. Upon successful completion of the previous step, the initiating chain will also block packet sends and begin flushing any in-flight packets on its channel end. Once both channel ends have completed flushing packets within the upgrade timeout window, both channel ends can be opened and upgraded to the new channel fields.

This will also set the upgrade timeout for the counterparty (i.e. the timeout before which the counterparty chain must move from FLUSHING to FLUSHCOMPLETE; if it doesn't then the chain will cancel the upgrade and write an error receipt). The timeout is a relative time duration in nanoseconds that can be changed with MsgUpdateParams and by default is 10 minutes. The state will change to FLUSHCOMPLETE once there are no in-flight packets left and the channel end is ready to move to OPEN. This flush state will also have an impact on how a channel ugrade can be cancelled, as detailed below. All other parameters will remain the same during the upgrade handshake until the upgrade handshake completes. When the channel is reset to OPEN on a successful upgrade handshake, the relevant fields on the channel end will be switched over to the UpgradeFields specified in the upgrade. note When transitioning a channel from UNORDERED to ORDERED, new packet sends from the channel end which upgrades first will be incapable of being timed out until the counterparty has finished upgrading. warning Due to the addition of new channel states, packets can still be received and processed in both FLUSHING and FLUSHCOMPLETE states. Packets can also be acknowledged in the FLUSHING state. Acknowledging will not be possible when the channel is in the FLUSHCOMPLETE state, since all packets sent from that channel end have been flushed. Application developers should consider these new states when implementing application logic that relies on the channel state.

Specifically with regard to IBC, core IBC maintains its own IAVL store, and IBC apps (e.g. transfer) maintain their own dedicated stores. The Cosmos SDK multistore therefore creates a simple merkle tree of all of these IAVL trees, and from each of these individual IAVL tree root hashes it derives a root hash for the application state tree as a whole (the AppHash).

However, there are cases where some functionality may be desired by many applications, yet not appropriate to place in core IBC. Middleware allows developers to define the extensions as separate modules that can wrap over the base application. This middleware can thus perform its own custom logic, and pass data into the application so that it may run its logic without being aware of the middleware's existence.

This underlying application may itself be middleware that is chained to a base application. Base Application: A base application is an IBC application that does not contain any middleware. It may be nested by 0 or multiple middleware to form an application stack. Application Stack (or stack): A stack is the complete set of application logic (middleware(s) + base application) that gets connected to core IBC. A stack may be just a base application, or it may be a series of middlewares that nest a base application. The diagram below gives an overview of a middleware stack consisting of two middleware (one stateless, the other stateful). Keep in mind that: The order of the middleware matters (more on how to correctly define your stack in the code will follow in the integration section). Depending on the type of message, it will either be passed on from the base application up the middleware stack to core IBC or down the stack in the reverse situation (handshake and packet callbacks). IBC middleware will wrap over an underlying IBC application and sits between core IBC and the application.

An IBC application may be wrapped by many layers of middleware, only the top layer middleware should be hooked to the IBC router, with all underlying middlewares and application getting wrapped by it.

A highly valued client might have hundreds of channels being actively used. Some of those channels might have a significant amount of locked tokens used for ICS 20. If the one third of the validator set of the chain the client represents decides to collude, they can sign off on two valid but conflicting headers each signed by the other one third of the honest validator set. The light client can now be updated with two valid, but conflicting headers at the same height. The light client cannot know which header is trustworthy and therefore evidence of such misbehaviour is likely to be submitted resulting in a frozen light client. Frozen light clients cannot be updated under any circumstance except via a governance proposal. Since a quorum of validators can sign arbitrary state roots which may not be valid executions of the state machine, a governance proposal has been added to ease the complexity of unfreezing or updating clients which have become \"stuck\". Without this mechanism, validator sets would need to construct a state root to unfreeze the client. Unfreezing clients, re-enables all of the channels built upon that client. This may result in recovery of otherwise lost funds. Tendermint light clients may become expired if the trusting period has passed since their last update. This may occur if relayers stop submitting headers to update the clients. An unplanned upgrade by the counterparty chain may also result in expired clients. If the counterparty chain undergoes an unplanned upgrade, there may be no commitment to that upgrade signed by the validator set before the chain ID changes. In this situation, the validator set of the last valid update for the light client is never expected to produce another valid header since the chain ID has changed, which will ultimately lead the on-chain light client to become expired. In the case that a highly valued light client is frozen, expired, or rendered non-updateable, a governance proposal may be submitted to update this client, known as the subject client. The proposal includes the client identifier for the subject and the client identifier for a substitute client. Light client implementations may implement custom updating logic, but in most cases, the subject will be updated to the latest consensus state of the substitute client, if the proposal passes. The substitute client is used as a \"stand in\" while the subject is on trial. It is best practice to create a substitute client after the subject has become frozen to avoid the substitute from also becoming frozen. An active substitute client allows headers to be submitted during the voting period to prevent accidental expiry once the proposal passes. note two of these parameters: AllowUpdateAfterExpiry and AllowUpdateAfterMisbehavior have been deprecated, and will both be set to false upon upgrades even if they were previously set to true.

The client identifier is auto generated using the client type and the global client counter appended in the format: {client-type}-{N}.

This allows IBC clients to distinguish between a block-height n of a previous revision of the chain (at revision p) and block-height n of the current revision of the chain (at revision e). Heights that share the same revision number can be compared by simply comparing their respective RevisionHeights. Heights that do not share the same revision number will only be compared using their respective RevisionNumbers.

Ex: Height{RevisionNumber: 3, RevisionHeight: 0} > Height{RevisionNumber: 2, RevisionHeight: 100000000000} When a Tendermint chain is running a particular revision, relayers can simply submit headers and proofs with the revision number given by the chain's chainID, and the revision height given by the Tendermint block height. When a chain updates using a hard-fork and resets its block-height, it is responsible for updating its chainID to increment the revision number. IBC Tendermint clients then verifies the revision number against their chainID and treat the RevisionHeight as the Tendermint block-height. Tendermint chains wishing to use revisions to maintain persistent IBC connections even across height-resetting upgrades must format their chainIDs in the following manner: {chainID}-{revision_number}. On any height-resetting upgrade, the chainID MUST be updated with a higher revision number than the previous value. Ex: Before upgrade chainID: gaiamainnet-3 After upgrade chainID: gaiamainnet-4 Clients that do not require revisions, such as the solo-machine client, simply hardcode 0 into the revision number whenever they need to return an IBC height when implementing IBC interfaces and use the RevisionHeight exclusively. Other client-types can implement their own logic to verify the IBC heights that relayers provide in their Update, Misbehavior, and Verify functions respectively. The IBC interfaces expect an ibcexported.Height interface, however all clients must use the concrete implementation provided in 02-client/types and reproduced above.","s":"IBC Client Heights","u":"/v8/ibc/overview/","h":"/v8/ibc/overview/#ibc-client-heights","p":2212},{"i":2222,"t":"Connections encapsulate two ConnectionEnd objects on two separate blockchains. Each ConnectionEnd is associated with a client of the other blockchain (for example, the counterparty blockchain). The connection handshake is responsible for verifying that the light clients on each chain are correct for their respective counterparties. Connections, once established, are responsible for facilitating all cross-chain verifications of IBC state. A connection can be associated with any number of channels. The connection handshake is a 4-step handshake. Briefly, if a given chain A wants to open a connection with chain B using already established light-clients on both chains: chain A sends a ConnectionOpenInit message to signal a connection initialization attempt with chain B. chain B sends a ConnectionOpenTry message to try opening the connection on chain A. chain A sends a ConnectionOpenAck message to mark its connection end state as open. chain B sends a ConnectionOpenConfirm message to mark its connection end state as open. Time Delayed Connections​ Connections can be opened with a time delay by setting the delayPeriod field (in nanoseconds) in the MsgConnectionOpenInit. The time delay is used to require that the underlying light clients have been updated to a certain height before commitment verification can be performed. delayPeriod is used in conjunction with the max_expected_time_per_block parameter of the connection submodule to determine the blockDelay, which is number of blocks that the connection must be delayed by. When commitment verification is performed, the connection submodule will pass delayPeriod and blockDelay to the light client. It is up to the light client to determine whether the light client has been updated to the required height. Only the following light clients in ibc-go support time delayed connections: 07-tendermint 08-wasm (passed to the contact)","s":"Connections","u":"/v8/ibc/overview/","h":"/v8/ibc/overview/#connections","p":2212},{"i":2224,"t":"In IBC, blockchains do not directly pass messages to each other over the network.

For example, for storing a specific connectionEnd as part of a handshake or a packet intended to be relayed to a module on the counterparty chain. A relayer process monitors for updates to these paths and relays messages by submitting the data stored under the path and a proof to the counterparty chain. Proofs are passed from core IBC to light-clients as bytes. It is up to light client implementation to interpret these bytes appropriately.

Thus, IBC must authenticate module actions on ports and channels so that only modules with the appropriate permissions can use them. This module authentication is accomplished using a dynamic capability store. Upon binding to a port or creating a channel for a module, IBC returns a dynamic capability that the module must claim in order to use that port or channel. The dynamic capability module prevents other modules from using that port or channel since they do not own the appropriate capability. While this background information is useful, IBC modules do not need to interact at all with these lower-level abstractions. The relevant abstraction layer for IBC application developers is that of channels and ports. IBC applications must be written as self-contained modules. A module on one blockchain can communicate with other modules on other blockchains by sending, receiving, and acknowledging packets through channels that are uniquely identified by the (channelID, portID) tuple. A useful analogy is to consider IBC modules as internet applications on a computer. A channel can then be conceptualized as an IP connection, with the IBC portID being analogous to an IP port and the IBC channelID being analogous to an IP address. Thus, a single instance of an IBC module can communicate on the same port with any number of other modules and IBC correctly routes all packets to the relevant module using the (channelID, portID tuple). An IBC module can also communicate with another IBC module over multiple ports, with each (portID<->portID) packet stream being sent on a different unique channel.","s":"Capabilities","u":"/v8/ibc/overview/","h":"/v8/ibc/overview/#capabilities","p":2212},{"i":2228,"t":"An IBC module can bind to any number of ports. Each port must be identified by a unique portID. Since IBC is designed to be secure with mutually distrusted modules operating on the same ledger, binding a port returns a dynamic object capability. In order to take action on a particular port (for example, an open channel with its portID), a module must provide the dynamic object capability to the IBC handler. This requirement prevents a malicious module from opening channels with ports it does not own. Thus, IBC modules are responsible for claiming the capability that is returned on BindPort.","s":"Ports","u":"/v8/ibc/overview/","h":"/v8/ibc/overview/#ports","p":2212},{"i":2230,"t":"An IBC channel can be established between two IBC ports. Currently, a port is exclusively owned by a single module. IBC packets are sent over channels. Just as IP packets contain the destination IP address and IP port, and the source IP address and source IP port, IBC packets contain the destination portID and channelID, and the source portID and channelID. This packet structure enables IBC to correctly route packets to the destination module while allowing modules receiving packets to know the sender module. A channel can be ORDERED, where packets from a sending module must be processed by the receiving module in the order they were sent. Or a channel can be UNORDERED, where packets from a sending module are processed in the order they arrive (might be in a different order than they were sent). Modules can choose which channels they wish to communicate over with, thus IBC expects modules to implement callbacks that are called during the channel handshake. These callbacks can do custom channel initialization logic. If any callback returns an error, the channel handshake fails. Thus, by returning errors on callbacks, modules can programmatically reject and accept channels. The channel handshake is a 4-step handshake. Briefly, if a given chain A wants to open a channel with chain B using an already established connection: chain A sends a ChanOpenInit message to signal a channel initialization attempt with chain B. chain B sends a ChanOpenTry message to try opening the channel on chain A. chain A sends a ChanOpenAck message to mark its channel end status as open. chain B sends a ChanOpenConfirm message to mark its channel end status as open. If all handshake steps are successful, the channel is opened on both sides. At each step in the handshake, the module associated with the ChannelEnd executes its callback. So on ChanOpenInit, the module on chain A executes its callback OnChanOpenInit. The channel identifier is auto derived in the format: channel-{N} where N is the next sequence to be used. Just as ports came with dynamic capabilities, channel initialization returns a dynamic capability that the module must claim so that they can pass in a capability to authenticate channel actions like sending packets. The channel capability is passed into the callback on the first parts of the handshake; either OnChanOpenInit on the initializing chain or OnChanOpenTry on the other chain. Closing channels​ Closing a channel occurs in 2 handshake steps as defined in ICS 04. Once a channel is closed, it cannot be reopened. The channel handshake steps are: ChanCloseInit closes a channel on the executing chain if the channel exists and it is not already closed, the connection it exists upon is OPEN, the IBC module callback OnChanCloseInit returns nil. ChanCloseInit can be initiated by any user by submitting a MsgChannelCloseInit transaction. Note that channels are automatically closed when a packet times out on an ORDERED channel. A timeout on an ORDERED channel skips the ChanCloseInit step and immediately closes the channel. ChanCloseConfirm is a response to a counterparty channel executing ChanCloseInit. The channel on the executing chain closes if the channel exists and is not already closed, the connection the channel exists upon is OPEN, the executing chain successfully verifies that the counterparty channel has been closed the IBC module callback OnChanCloseConfirm returns nil. Currently, none of the IBC applications provided in ibc-go support ChanCloseInit.","s":"Channels","u":"/v8/ibc/overview/","h":"/v8/ibc/overview/#channels","p":2212},{"i":2232,"t":"Modules communicate with each other by sending packets over IBC channels. All IBC packets contain the destination portID and channelID along with the source portID and channelID. This packet structure allows modules to know the sender module of a given packet. IBC packets contain a sequence to optionally enforce ordering. IBC packets also contain a TimeoutHeight and a TimeoutTimestamp that determine the deadline before the receiving module must process a packet. Modules send custom application data to each other inside the Data []byte field of the IBC packet. Thus, packet data is opaque to IBC handlers. It is incumbent on a sender module to encode their application-specific packet information into the Data field of packets. The receiver module must decode that Data back to the original application data.","s":"Packets","u":"/v8/ibc/overview/","h":"/v8/ibc/overview/#packets","p":2212},{"i":2234,"t":"Since IBC works over a distributed network and relies on potentially faulty relayers to relay messages between ledgers, IBC must handle the case where a packet does not get sent to its destination in a timely manner or at all. Packets must specify a non-zero value for timeout height (TimeoutHeight) or timeout timestamp (TimeoutTimestamp ) after which a packet can no longer be successfully received on the destination chain. The timeoutHeight indicates a consensus height on the destination chain after which the packet is no longer be processed, and instead counts as having timed-out. The timeoutTimestamp indicates a timestamp on the destination chain after which the packet is no longer be processed, and instead counts as having timed-out. If the timeout passes without the packet being successfully received, the packet can no longer be received on the destination chain. The sending module can timeout the packet and take appropriate actions. If the timeout is reached, then a proof of packet timeout can be submitted to the original chain. The original chain can then perform application-specific logic to timeout the packet, perhaps by rolling back the packet send changes (refunding senders any locked funds, etc.). In ORDERED channels, a timeout of a single packet in the channel causes the channel to close. If packet sequence n times out, then a packet at sequence k > n cannot be received without violating the contract of ORDERED channels that packets are processed in the order that they are sent. Since ORDERED channels enforce this invariant, a proof that sequence n has not been received on the destination chain by the specified timeout of packet n is sufficient to timeout packet n and close the channel. In UNORDERED channels, the application-specific timeout logic for that packet is applied and the channel is not closed. Packets can be received in any order. IBC writes a packet receipt for each sequence receives in the UNORDERED channel. This receipt does not contain information; it is simply a marker intended to signify that the UNORDERED channel has received a packet at the specified sequence. To timeout a packet on an UNORDERED channel, a proof is required that a packet receipt does not exist for the packet's sequence by the specified timeout. For this reason, most modules should use UNORDERED channels as they require fewer liveness guarantees to function effectively for users of that channel.","s":"Receipts and Timeouts","u":"/v8/ibc/overview/","h":"/v8/ibc/overview/#receipts-and-timeouts","p":2212},{"i":2236,"t":"Modules can also choose to write application-specific acknowledgments upon processing a packet. Acknowledgments can be done: Synchronously on OnRecvPacket if the module processes packets as soon as they are received from IBC module. Asynchronously if module processes packets at some later point after receiving the packet. This acknowledgment data is opaque to IBC much like the packet Data and is treated by IBC as a simple byte string []byte. Receiver modules must encode their acknowledgment so that the sender module can decode it correctly. The encoding must be negotiated between the two parties during version negotiation in the channel handshake. The acknowledgment can encode whether the packet processing succeeded or failed, along with additional information that allows the sender module to take appropriate action. After the acknowledgment has been written by the receiving chain, a relayer relays the acknowledgment back to the original sender module. The original sender module then executes application-specific acknowledgment logic using the contents of the acknowledgment. After an acknowledgement fails, packet-send changes can be rolled back (for example, refunding senders in ICS20). After an acknowledgment is received successfully on the original sender on the chain, the corresponding packet commitment is deleted since it is no longer needed.","s":"Acknowledgments","u":"/v8/ibc/overview/","h":"/v8/ibc/overview/#acknowledgments","p":2212},{"i":2238,"t":"If you want to learn more about IBC, check the following specifications: IBC specification overview","s":"Further Readings and Specs","u":"/v8/ibc/overview/","h":"/v8/ibc/overview/#further-readings-and-specs","p":2212},{"i":2240,"t":"See ibc-go Buf Protobuf documentation.","s":"Protobuf documentation","u":"/v8/ibc/proto-docs/","h":"","p":2239},{"i":2242,"t":"note Pre-requisite readings​ IBC Overview Events","s":"Relayer","u":"/v8/ibc/relayer/","h":"","p":2241},{"i":2244,"t":"IBC Overview Events","s":"Pre-requisite readings","u":"/v8/ibc/relayer/","h":"/v8/ibc/relayer/#pre-requisite-readings","p":2241},{"i":2246,"t":"Events are emitted for every transaction processed by the base application to indicate the execution of some logic clients may want to be aware of.

If a relayer queries for transaction events, it can split message events using this event Type/Attribute Key pair. The Event Type message with the Attribute Key module may be emitted multiple times for a single message due to application callbacks.

A relayer should use the message.action key to extract the number of messages in the transaction and the type of IBC transactions sent. For every IBC transaction within the string array for message.action, the necessary information should be extracted from the other event fields.

Currently the only option available is the WithQueryPlugins option, which allows registration of custom query plugins for the 08-wasm module. The use of this API is optional and it is only required if the chain wants to register custom query plugins for the 08-wasm module. WithQueryPlugins​ By default, the 08-wasm module does not configure any querier options for light client contracts. However, it is possible to register custom query plugins for QueryRequest::Custom and QueryRequest::Stargate. Assuming that the keeper is not yet instantiated, the following sample code shows how to register query plugins for the 08-wasm module. We first construct a QueryPlugins object with the desired query plugins: queryPlugins := ibcwasmtypes.QueryPlugins { Custom: MyCustomQueryPlugin(), // `myAcceptList` is a `[]string` containing the list of gRPC query paths that the chain wants to allow for the `08-wasm` module to query. // These queries must be registered in the chain's gRPC query router, be deterministic, and track their gas usage. // The `AcceptListStargateQuerier` function will return a query plugin that will only allow queries for the paths in the `myAcceptList`. // The query responses are encoded in protobuf unlike the implementation in `x/wasm`. Stargate: ibcwasmtypes.AcceptListStargateQuerier(myAcceptList), } Note that the Stargate querier appends the user defined accept list of query routes to a default list defined by the 08-wasm module. The defaultAcceptList defines a single query route: \"/ibc.core.client.v1.Query/VerifyMembership\". This allows for light client smart contracts to delegate parts of their workflow to other light clients for auxiliary proof verification. For example, proof of inclusion of block and tx data by a data availability provider. // defaultAcceptList defines a set of default allowed queries made available to the Querier. var defaultAcceptList = []string{ \"/ibc.core.client.v1.Query/VerifyMembership\", } You may leave any of the fields in the QueryPlugins object as nil if you do not want to register a query plugin for that query type. Then, we pass the QueryPlugins object to the WithQueryPlugins option: querierOption := ibcwasmkeeper.WithQueryPlugins(&queryPlugins) Finally, we pass the option to the NewKeeperWithConfig or NewKeeperWithVM constructor function during Keeper instantiation: app.WasmClientKeeper = ibcwasmkeeper.NewKeeperWithConfig( appCodec, runtime.NewKVStoreService(keys[ibcwasmtypes.StoreKey]), app.IBCKeeper.ClientKeeper, authtypes.NewModuleAddress(govtypes.ModuleName).String(), wasmConfig, app.GRPCQueryRouter(), + querierOption, ) app.WasmClientKeeper = ibcwasmkeeper.NewKeeperWithVM( appCodec, runtime.NewKVStoreService(keys[ibcwasmtypes.StoreKey]), app.IBCKeeper.ClientKeeper, authtypes.NewModuleAddress(govtypes.ModuleName).String(), wasmer, // pass the Wasm VM instance to `08-wasm` keeper constructor app.GRPCQueryRouter(), + querierOption, )","s":"Options","u":"/v8/ibc/light-clients/wasm/integration/","h":"/v8/ibc/light-clients/wasm/integration/#options","p":2269},{"i":2284,"t":"If the chain's 02-client submodule parameter AllowedClients contains the single wildcard \"*\" element, then it is not necessary to do anything in order to allow the creation of 08-wasm clients.

All of the following upgrades must be planned and committed to in advance by the upgrading chain, in order for counterparty clients to maintain their connections securely. Note: Since upgrades are only implemented for Tendermint clients, this doc only discusses upgrades on Tendermint chains that would break counterparty IBC Tendermint Clients. Changing the Chain-ID: Supported Changing the UnbondingPeriod: Partially Supported, chains may increase the unbonding period with no issues.

Changing the ProofSpecs: Supported, this should be changed if the proof structure needed to verify IBC proofs is changed across the upgrade.

Upgrading chains should try to avoid these situations by not altering parameters that can break old clients. For an example, see the UnbondingPeriod example in the supported upgrades section.

IBC apps would send a packet to core IBC, and receive a callback on every step of that packet's lifecycle. This allows IBC applications to be built on top of core IBC, and to be able to execute custom logic on packet lifecycle events (e.g. unescrow tokens for ICS-20). This setup worked well for off-chain users interacting with IBC applications. However, we are now seeing the desire for secondary applications (e.g. smart contracts, modules) to call into IBC apps as part of their state machine logic and then do some actions on packet lifecycle events. The Callbacks Middleware allows for this functionality by allowing the packets of the underlying IBC applications to register callbacks to secondary applications for lifecycle events. These callbacks are then executed by the Callbacks Middleware when the corresponding packet lifecycle event occurs. After much discussion, the design was expanded to an ADR, and the Callbacks Middleware is an implementation of that ADR.","s":"What is the Callbacks Middleware?","u":"/v8/middleware/callbacks/overview/","h":"/v8/middleware/callbacks/overview/#what-is-the-callbacks-middleware","p":2348},{"i":2353,"t":"Callbacks Middleware was built with smart contracts in mind, but can be used by any secondary application that wants to allow IBC packets to call into it. Think of the Callbacks Middleware as a bridge between core IBC and a secondary application. We have the following definitions: Underlying IBC application: The IBC application that is wrapped by the Callbacks Middleware. This is the IBC application that is actually sending and receiving packet lifecycle events from core IBC. For example, the transfer module, or the ICA controller submodule. IBC Actor: IBC Actor is an on-chain or off-chain entity that can initiate a packet on the underlying IBC application. For example, a smart contract, an off-chain user, or a module that sends a transfer packet are all IBC Actors. Secondary application: The application that is being called into by the Callbacks Middleware for packet lifecycle events. This is the application that is receiving the callback directly from the Callbacks Middleware module. For example, the x/wasm module. Callback Actor: The on-chain smart contract or module that is registered to receive callbacks from the secondary application. For example, a Wasm smart contract (gatekeeped by the x/wasm module). Note that the Callback Actor is not necessarily the same as the IBC Actor. For example, an off-chain user can initiate a packet on the underlying IBC application, but the Callback Actor could be a smart contract. The secondary application may want to check that the IBC Actor is allowed to call into the Callback Actor, for example, by checking that the IBC Actor is the same as the Callback Actor. Callback Address: Address of the Callback Actor. This is the address that the secondary application will call into when a packet lifecycle event occurs. For example, the address of the Wasm smart contract. Maximum gas limit: The maximum amount of gas that the Callbacks Middleware will allow the secondary application to use when it executes its custom logic. User defined gas limit: The amount of gas that the IBC Actor wants to allow the secondary application to use when it executes its custom logic. This is the gas limit that the IBC Actor specifies when it sends a packet to the underlying IBC application. This cannot be greater than the maximum gas limit. Think of the secondary application as a bridge between the Callbacks Middleware and the Callback Actor. The secondary application is responsible for executing the custom logic of the Callback Actor when a packet lifecycle event occurs. The secondary application is also responsible for checking that the IBC Actor is allowed to call into the Callback Actor. Note that it is possible that the IBC Actor, Secondary Application, and Callback Actor are all the same entity. In which case, the Callback Address should be the secondary application's module address.

The receive packet callback does not pass the relayer address to the secondary application. This is so that we can use the same callback for both synchronous and asynchronous acknowledgements. The receive packet callback does not pass IBC Actor's address, this is because the IBC Actor lives in the counterparty chain and cannot be trusted.","s":"Known Limitations","u":"/v8/middleware/callbacks/overview/","h":"/v8/middleware/callbacks/overview/#known-limitations","p":2348},{"i":2357,"t":"IBC middleware will wrap over an underlying IBC application (a base application or downstream middleware) and sits between core IBC and the base application.

Middleware accomplishes this by formatting the version in a JSON-encoded string containing the middleware version and the application version. The application version may as well be a JSON-encoded string, possibly including further middleware and app versions, if the application stack consists of multiple milddlewares wrapping a base application. The format of the version is specified in ICS-30 as the following: { \"<middleware_version_key>\": \"<middleware_version_value>\", \"app_version\": \"<application_version_value>\" } The <middleware_version_key> key in the JSON struct should be replaced by the actual name of the key for the corresponding middleware (e.g. fee_version). During the handshake callbacks, the middleware can unmarshal the version string and retrieve the middleware and application versions. It can do its negotiation logic on <middleware_version_value>, and pass the <application_version_value> to the underlying application. NOTE: Middleware that does not need to negotiate with a counterparty middleware on the remote stack will not implement the version unmarshalling and negotiation, and will simply perform its own custom logic on the callbacks without relying on the counterparty behaving similarly.

Though relaying is permissionless and completely decentralized and accessible, it does come with operational costs. Running full nodes to query transaction proofs and paying for transaction fees associated with IBC packets are two of the primary cost burdens which have driven the overall discussion on a general, in-protocol incentivization mechanism for relayers. Initially, a simple proposal was created to incentivize relaying on ICS20 token transfers on the destination chain. However, the proposal was specific to ICS20 token transfers and would have to be reimplemented in this format on every other IBC application module. After much discussion, the proposal was expanded to a general incentivisation design that can be adopted by any ICS application protocol as middleware.","s":"What is the Fee Middleware module?","u":"/v8/middleware/ics29-fee/overview/","h":"/v8/middleware/ics29-fee/overview/#what-is-the-fee-middleware-module","p":2414},{"i":2419,"t":"ICS29 fee payments in this middleware design are built on the assumption that sender chains are the source of incentives — the chain on which packets are incentivized is the chain that distributes fees to relayer operators.

This introduces the requirement of a mapping of relayer operator's addresses on both chains. To achieve the stated requirements, the fee middleware module has two main groups of functionality: Registering of relayer addresses associated with each party involved in relaying the packet on the source chain.

The Base Application was intended to be composed with the ICS27 controller submodule Keeper and facilitate many forms of message authentication depending on a chain's particular use case. Prior to ibc-go v6 the controller submodule exposed only these two functions (to which we will refer as the legacy APIs): RegisterInterchainAccount SendTx However, these functions have now been deprecated in favour of the new controller submodule MsgServer and will be removed in later releases. Both APIs remain functional and maintain backwards compatibility in ibc-go v6, however consumers of these APIs are now recommended to follow the message passing paradigm outlined in Cosmos SDK ADR 031 and ADR 033. This is facilitated by the Cosmos SDK MsgServiceRouter and chain developers creating custom application logic can now omit the ICS27 controller submodule Keeper from their module and instead depend on message routing. Depending on the use case, developers of custom authentication modules face one of three scenarios: My authentication module needs to access IBC packet callbacks Application developers that wish to consume IBC packet callbacks and react upon packet acknowledgements must continue using the controller submodule's legacy APIs. The authentication modules will not need a ScopedKeeper anymore, though, because the channel capability will be claimed by the controller submodule. For example, given an Interchain Accounts authentication module keeper ICAAuthKeeper, the authentication module's ScopedKeeper (scopedICAAuthKeeper) is not needed anymore and can be removed for the argument list of the keeper constructor function, as shown here: app.ICAAuthKeeper = icaauthkeeper.NewKeeper( appCodec, keys[icaauthtypes.StoreKey], app.ICAControllerKeeper, - scopedICAAuthKeeper, ) Please note that the authentication module's ScopedKeeper name is still needed as part of the channel capability migration described in section Upgrade proposal above. Therefore the authentication module's ScopedKeeper cannot be completely removed from the chain code until the migration has run. In the future, the use of the legacy APIs for accessing packet callbacks will be replaced by IBC Actor Callbacks (see ADR 008 for more details) and it will also be possible to access them with the MsgServiceRouter. My authentication module does not need access to IBC packet callbacks The authentication module can migrate from using the legacy APIs and it can be composed instead with the MsgServiceRouter, so that the authentication module is able to pass messages to the controller submodule's MsgServer to register interchain accounts and send packets to the interchain account. For example, given an Interchain Accounts authentication module keeper ICAAuthKeeper, the ICS27 controller submodule keeper (ICAControllerKeeper) and authentication module scoped keeper (scopedICAAuthKeeper) are not needed anymore and can be replaced with the MsgServiceRouter, as shown here: app.ICAAuthKeeper = icaauthkeeper.NewKeeper( appCodec, keys[icaauthtypes.StoreKey], - app.ICAControllerKeeper, - scopedICAAuthKeeper, + app.MsgServiceRouter(), ) In your authentication module you can route messages to the controller submodule's MsgServer instead of using the legacy APIs. For example, for registering an interchain account: - if err := keeper.icaControllerKeeper.RegisterInterchainAccount( - ctx, - connectionID, - owner.String(), - version, - ); err != nil { - return err - } + msg := controllertypes.NewMsgRegisterInterchainAccount( + connectionID, + owner.String(), + version, + ) + handler := keeper.msgRouter.Handler(msg) + res, err := handler(ctx, msg) + if err != nil { + return err + } where controllertypes is an import alias for \"github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v6/modules/apps/27-interchain-accounts/controller/types\". In addition, in this use case the authentication module does not need to implement the IBCModule interface anymore. I do not need a custom authentication module anymore If your authentication module does not have any extra functionality compared to the default authentication module added in ibc-go v6 (the MsgServer), or if you can use a generic authentication module, such as the x/auth, x/gov or x/group modules from the Cosmos SDK (v0.46 and later), then you can remove your authentication module completely and use instead the gRPC endpoints of the MsgServer or the CLI added in ibc-go v6. Please remember that the authentication module's ScopedKeeper name is still needed as part of the channel capability migration described in section Upgrade proposal above. Host params​ The ICS27 host submodule default params have been updated to include the AllowAllHostMsgs wildcard *. This enables execution of any sdk.Msg type for ICS27 registered on the host chain InterfaceRegistry. // AllowAllHostMsgs holds the string key that allows all message types on interchain accounts host module const AllowAllHostMsgs = \"*\" ... // DefaultParams is the default parameter configuration for the host submodule func DefaultParams() Params { - return NewParams(DefaultHostEnabled, nil) + return NewParams(DefaultHostEnabled, []string{AllowAllHostMsgs}) } API breaking changes​ SerializeCosmosTx takes in a []proto.Message instead of []sdk.Message. This allows for the serialization of proto messages without requiring the fulfillment of the sdk.Msg interface. The 27-interchain-accounts genesis types have been moved to their own package: modules/apps/27-interchain-acccounts/genesis/types. This change facilitates the addition of the ICS27 controller submodule MsgServer and avoids cyclic imports. This should have minimal disruption to chain developers integrating 27-interchain-accounts. The ICS27 host submodule NewKeeper function in modules/apps/27-interchain-acccounts/host/keeper now includes an additional parameter of type ICS4Wrapper. This provides the host submodule with the ability to correctly unwrap channel versions in the event of a channel reopening handshake. func NewKeeper( cdc codec.BinaryCodec, key storetypes.StoreKey, paramSpace paramtypes.Subspace, - channelKeeper icatypes.ChannelKeeper, portKeeper icatypes.PortKeeper, + ics4Wrapper icatypes.ICS4Wrapper, channelKeeper icatypes.ChannelKeeper, portKeeper icatypes.PortKeeper, accountKeeper icatypes.AccountKeeper, scopedKeeper icatypes.ScopedKeeper, msgRouter icatypes.MessageRouter, ) Keeper","s":"ICS27 - Interchain Accounts","u":"/v8/migrations/v5-to-v6/","h":"/v8/migrations/v5-to-v6/#ics27---interchain-accounts","p":2545},{"i":2555,"t":"The NewKeeper function of ICS29 has been updated to remove the paramSpace parameter as it was unused. func NewKeeper( - cdc codec.BinaryCodec, key storetypes.StoreKey, paramSpace paramtypes.Subspace, - ics4Wrapper types.ICS4Wrapper, channelKeeper types.ChannelKeeper, portKeeper types.PortKeeper, authKeeper types.AccountKeeper, bankKeeper types.BankKeeper, + cdc codec.BinaryCodec, key storetypes.StoreKey, + ics4Wrapper types.ICS4Wrapper, channelKeeper types.ChannelKeeper, + portKeeper types.PortKeeper, authKeeper types.AccountKeeper, bankKeeper types.BankKeeper, ) Keeper {","s":"ICS29 - NewKeeper API change","u":"/v8/migrations/v5-to-v6/","h":"/v8/migrations/v5-to-v6/#ics29---newkeeper-api-change","p":2545},{"i":2557,"t":"The SendTransfer function of ICS20 has been removed.

The client state and consensus state return values have been removed. Light clients must handle all management of client and consensus states including the setting of updated client state and consensus state in the client store. The Initialize method is now expected to set the initial client state, consensus state and any client-specific metadata in the provided store upon client creation. The CheckHeaderAndUpdateState method has been split into 4 new methods: VerifyClientMessage verifies a ClientMessage. A ClientMessage could be a Header, Misbehaviour, or batch update. Calls to CheckForMisbehaviour, UpdateState, and UpdateStateOnMisbehaviour will assume that the content of the ClientMessage has been verified and can be trusted. An error should be returned if the ClientMessage fails to verify. CheckForMisbehaviour checks for evidence of a misbehaviour in Header or Misbehaviour types. UpdateStateOnMisbehaviour performs appropriate state changes on a ClientState given that misbehaviour has been detected and verified. UpdateState updates and stores as necessary any associated information for an IBC client, such as the ClientState and corresponding ConsensusState. An error is returned if ClientMessage is of type Misbehaviour. Upon successful update, a list containing the updated consensus state height is returned. The CheckMisbehaviourAndUpdateState function has been removed from ClientState interface. This functionality is now encapsulated by the usage of VerifyClientMessage, CheckForMisbehaviour, UpdateStateOnMisbehaviour. The function GetTimestampAtHeight has been added to the ClientState interface. It should return the timestamp for a consensus state associated with the provided height. Prior to ibc-go/v7 the ClientState interface defined a method for each data type which was being verified in the counterparty state store. The state verification functions for all IBC data types have been consolidated into two generic methods, VerifyMembership and VerifyNonMembership. Both are expected to be provided with a standardised key path, exported.Path, as defined in ICS 24 host requirements. Membership verification requires callers to provide the marshalled value []byte. Delay period values should be zero for non-packet processing verification. A zero proof height is now allowed by core IBC and may be passed into VerifyMembership and VerifyNonMembership. Light clients are responsible for returning an error if a zero proof height is invalid behaviour. See below for an example of how ibc-go now performs channel state verification. merklePath := commitmenttypes.NewMerklePath(host.ChannelPath(portID, channelID)) merklePath, err := commitmenttypes.ApplyPrefix(connection.GetCounterparty().GetPrefix(), merklePath) if err != nil { return err } channelEnd, ok := channel.(channeltypes.Channel) if !ok { return sdkerrors.Wrapf(sdkerrors.ErrInvalidType, \"invalid channel type %T\", channel) } bz, err := k.cdc.Marshal(&channelEnd) if err != nil { return err } if err := clientState.VerifyMembership( ctx, clientStore, k.cdc, height, 0, 0, // skip delay period checks for non-packet processing verification proof, merklePath, bz, ); err != nil { return sdkerrors.Wrapf(err, \"failed channel state verification for client (%s)\", clientID) }","s":"ClientState interface changes","u":"/v8/migrations/v6-to-v7/","h":"/v8/migrations/v6-to-v7/#clientstate-interface-changes","p":2578},{"i":2594,"t":"exported.Header and exported.Misbehaviour interface types have been merged and renamed to ClientMessage interface.
